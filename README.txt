This Program will Concatanate multiple .JSON files together.

Each node will accumlate data in 10 minute intervals and store that's interval Data as a .JSON File.
	ex:{"node 1": [{"2017-02-17 17:10": [72.41166167091251, 55.62540112634293, 0.7011012024929225, 96496.277, 8.629700484443234, "SW", "pic_str"]}, 32.77566, -117.071543]}
This data is needed to be concatanated nack into the larger .JSON file where all of the Data would be stored. This program concatanates the new data with the previous data accordingly.
